Welcome to the Rust for Linux Kernel Experiments repository. <br />
This project contains experiments focused on exploring the support for the Rust programming language within the Linux kernel. Specifically, we will be creating out-of-tree kernel modules to investigate the extent to which Rust can be integrated and utilized in kernel development.

## Introduction
Rust is a modern programming language that promises memory safety and concurrency without sacrificing performance. These features make it an attractive candidate for systems programming, including operating system kernels. This repository contains a series of experimental out-of-tree modules for the Linux kernel written in Rust, designed to test the capabilities and limitations of Rust in this context.

## Project Goals
-   Explore Rust Integration: Investigate the integration of Rust with the Linux kernel.
-   Develop Kernel Modules: Create and test out-of-tree kernel modules written in Rust.
-   Document Findings: Share the results, challenges, and solutions encountered during the experiments.
-   Contribute to the Community: Provide valuable insights and potential contributions to the Linux and Rust communities.

## Current Progess
### Kprobes Module
Currently, the repository includes a single module called Kprobes. This module demonstrates how Rust can interact with C code to register Kprobes within a Rust-based kernel module. Kprobes is a powerful debugging mechanism in the Linux kernel, allowing you to dynamically break into any kernel routine and collect debugging and performance information non-disruptively.

**Features of the Kprobes Module**
- Interaction with C Code: The module interacts with existing C code to leverage Kprobe functionality.
- Registration of Kprobes: It allows for the registration and management of Kprobes from within a Rust module.
